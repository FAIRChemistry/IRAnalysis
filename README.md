# IRAnalysis
Toolkit for the analysis IR spectroscopic data.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is IRAnalysis?
IRAnalysis presents, as of now, a toolkit to process, analyze, fit and plot data obtained from FT-IR measurements. All data and analysis steps are stored in a data model which can be later exported to ensure reproducability.

## üì¶ Installation

The tool is built on python 3.10. The following packages are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- astropy
- jupyter
- pybaselines
- sdRDM
***
To install packages with pip or anaconda run either

```bash
python -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy astropy jupyter pybaselines
```
or  
```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy astropy jupyter pybaselines
```
***
The datamodel is built with [sdRDM](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/software-driven-rdm). To install either run
```bash
python -m pip install sdRDM
```
or build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JR-1991/software-driven-rdm.git
cd software-driven-rdm
python3 setup.py install
```
***
The tool itself is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/IRAnalysis/) by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/IRAnalysis/
```
