# IRAnalysis
Toolkit for the analysis of Pyridine-adsorbed IR data

## üõ†Ô∏è What is IRAnalysis?
IRAnalysis presents, as of now, a toolkit to analyze, fit and plot data obtained from pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR measurements. For now, only two or three peaks in the wavenumber range of 1600 - 1400 cm$\^{-1}$ (ring breathing vibrations) can be fitted with Gaussians.
