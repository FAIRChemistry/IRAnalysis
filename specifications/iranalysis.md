## Enumerations

### MeasurementTypes

Possible types of measurements to be used during analysis

```python
BACKGROUND = "background"
SAMPLE = "sample"
```

### Detection

Detection method used in the experiment. "Transmission" expects minima in the spectrum for the bands. "Intensity" or "Absorbance" treats bands as maxima in the spectrum.

```python
TRANSMITTANCE = "transmittance"
ABSORBANCE = "absorbance"
INTENSITY = "intensity"
```
